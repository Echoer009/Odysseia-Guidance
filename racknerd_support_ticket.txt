**Subject: Inbound connection to Port 80 is being refused on VPS (IP: 216.45.58.126)**

Dear RackNerd Support Team,

I am writing to request assistance with a network issue on my VPS with the IP address 216.45.58.126.

I am trying to set up a web server and obtain an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt (Certbot). However, the process fails every time with a "Connection refused" error. This indicates that external requests to my server's port 80 are being actively rejected.

I have performed the following troubleshooting steps to diagnose the issue from my end:
1.  I have confirmed that my Nginx web server is running correctly. The output of the `ss -tlpn` command shows that Nginx is successfully listening on `0.0.0.0:80`.
2.  I have checked the server's internal firewall (ufw), and its status is confirmed to be `inactive`.
3.  I have checked my SolusVM control panel and could not find any user-configurable firewall or network security group settings.

Given that the server's application and internal firewall are correctly configured to accept connections, I suspect there might be an upstream firewall or network policy at the infrastructure level that is blocking inbound traffic to port 80 for my VPS.

Could you please investigate whether this is the case? If so, could you please open inbound access for TCP ports 80 and 443 to my VPS (216.45.58.126)?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
